## 🚦 EcoRoutes – Emissions-Based Route Optimization for Smart Cities
This project simulates a city road network with varying traffic densities and applies **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to compute:
- 🏎️ The **Quickest Route** – Based purely on distance.
- 🌱 The **Eco-Friendly Route** – Optimized for lower traffic, emissions, and fuel consumption.

## 🌐 Project Motivation
With the rise of urban congestion and climate change, route planning should consider both **time efficiency** and **environmental impact**. This project provides a framework for:
- Carbon-conscious route recommendations,
- Smart city transport simulations,
- Educational insights into graph algorithms.

## 🔍 Features
- ✅ Simulates a city traffic grid with random traffic density
- ✅ Two-path optimization: Distance vs. Emissions
- ✅ Heatmap-like visualization for traffic
- ✅ Fuel consumption & CO₂ emission stats
- ✅ Interactive Folium maps (planned or partial)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX
- OSMnx / Folium
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
