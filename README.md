# EcoRoutes-Algorithm
EcoRoutes simulates a smart city traffic grid using Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the quickest and most eco-friendly routes. It includes traffic-based weight mapping, route visualization, and emissions analysis—ideal for sustainable urban mobility and route optimization research.
